Hi! I'm Matthew, a native Wyomingite who found more 
interest in programming than herding cattle.
I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a 
degree in computer science before moving
to Austin to work as a software engineer.

I created this blog as a place to organize and archive
the ideas that excite me for personal future reference and occasional sharing with others.

# FAQ
- Matthew's Swap Space?

    In operating systems, the
    [swap space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/)
    refers to a region of disk that can be treated as
    virtual memory when more memory is allocated than
    can fit into RAM. If you'll work with me through the
    *loose* metaphor, I mean for this blog to eat up
    the spillage of those thoughts that I have a hard
    time fitting just in my head.
