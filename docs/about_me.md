Hi! I'm Matthew, a native Wyomingite who found more 
interest in programming than herding cattle.
I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a 
degree in computer science before moving
to Austin, Texas to work as a software engineer.

I created this blog as a place to organize and archive
the ideas that excite me for personal future reference and occasional sharing with others.

# FAQ
- Matthew's Swap Space?

    In operating systems, the
    [swap space](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-in-operating-system/)
    refers to a region of disk that can be treated as
    virtual memory when more memory is allocated than
    can fit into RAM. If you'll work with me through the
    *loose* metaphore, I mean for this blog to eat up
    the spillage of those thoughts that I have a hard
    time fitting just in my head.

- Shirt Size?

    Depends on the shirt! For the average shirt, I'd go
    large for comfort and safety but I prefer medium
    for higher end shirts and jackets/coats.

- Shoe size?

    9.5 is usually perfect, I round up to a 10 if
    9.5 is not available.
