# Problem Definition
So that we can evaluate different strategies quantitatively, let's formally set up the problem:

## Our Objective
The primary objective in any fantasy football season is to win! Our commish runs the league head-to-head where teams are
matched against eachother each week and the team with more points scoerd wins. At the end of the season, the team with
the most overall wins will be crowned champion.

This makes sense as a general objective but is hard to computationally optimize for. To really get at any strategy's
value, one would have to account for the teams they are paired up against and the overall standings of other players in 
the league. This works just fine for human players, but our data for past seasons only captures raw player standings, not 
any particular league's matchups or weekly standings. As a result, we'll try to optimize for a slightly less ambitious 
proxy that, under some assmuptions, should also improve our chances to win the league.

That proxy we will measure peformance for is average points scored per week. Formally, we want to build a strategy that 
**maximizes the mean quantity of points we score each week**.

## Our Control Panel
Towards the objective laid out above, we should enumerate the buttons and levers in front of us through which we express 
our strategy. In fantasy, there are *many* components that make up one's strategy: initial drafting, trades, bench 
swapping, and more. We *could* model for all of this. I *could* also uproot my life and hike the Appalachian trail for a 
several months. We don't have the time!

To keep our scope realistic, I am choosing to limit our strategies to the initial draft and bench swapping. This choice
is made since, I hypothesize, much of one's success in a fantasy football season is determined by the quality of players
they can lock down onto their roster and then maximizing their roster's effect throughout the season. This also allows us
to account for weeks where a particular player doesn't play or is injured.

So, our objective is more specific yet: **How can we design a draft and bench management strategy to maximize average
points scored per week?**

## Our Resources
The types of strategies we can use depend greatly on what data and technology we have at our disposal. The root source of
information I'll be using for strategy modeling will be historic fantasy data that I can get my hands on for free. The
data was provided courtesy of [Fantasy Data Pros](https://www.fantasydatapros.com/) found at
[https://github.com/bendominguez0111/fantasy-csv-data](https://github.com/bendominguez0111/fantasy-csv-data). The
data provides weekly performance numbers put up by all players in the league between 1999 and 2021, including the number
of fantasy points scored under a few different rule sets. My hardware budget includes just my personal laptop, so no
[billion-parameter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model#Training_cost) models being trained around here.

# Problem Insights
Before stabbing at particular strategies, let's lay out and research some general intuition that helps guide our thinking.

## Not all positions are made equal
Perhaps on the field all positions are made equal, but, in fantasy, some positions are certainly more equal than others.
Due to the rule set, any team will likely get many more points from their Quarterback (QB) than their Kicker (K). This
is well understood, but let's see the numbers.

I took each player in the data set and computed the average number of points they scored per week in each season they
played. With those `(player, year)` pairs, I plotted a histogram displaying the distribution of average points scored
per week. Within each bar, the data is further separated by the players' positions on the fields.

I make two observations about this figure:

1. The position with the greatest count of players is Wide Receiver (WR)

2. The highest scoring players on average are QBs, WRs, and Running Backs (RBs).

One important note to make is that, no matter what, each team will need to draft a number of players in each position.
Under our rules, it's as follows:

| Role  | Player Count |
|-------|--------------|
| QB    | 1            |
| WR    | 2            |
| RB    | 2            |
| TE    | 1            |
| W/R/T | 1            |
| DEF   | 1            |
| BN    | 6            |
| IR    | 2            |

Note W/R/T is a flex pick between WR, RB, and TE. DEF refers to which team's defense you select, BN refers to the number
of players on bench, and IR is a special slot reserved for injured players.

I will argue that it's not *immediately* clear why you should prioritize drafting a good QB over a good TE. You'll need
both a QB and a TE at the end of the day, so just the fact that QBs earn more points than TEs isn't sufficient on its own
to prioritize the QB in the draft. Consider a case where there are just two teams drafting from a pool of three QBs and
three TEs. Also suppose you know exactly how much points each will get you:

| Position | Name             | Points per week |
|----------|------------------|-----------------|
| QB       | John F. Football | 20              |
| QB       | Mahmoud Longarm  | 20              |
| QB       | Barry Footon     | 20              |
| TE       | Kevin Park       | 5               |
| TE       | Ronald McDonald  | 6               |
| TE       | Nacho Libre      | 12              |

In this example, sure, QBs make more points than TEs. Still, the best draft pick in round 1 is easily Nacho Libre, since
you know you'll get a good QB anyways and you know the adversary will be forced to choose a weak TE. If I draft Nacho
Libre, then you draft John F. Football and Ronald McDonald, then I finish my draft with Mahmoud Longarm, then I will
expect 32 points a week while you get a mere 26.

The takeaway? You don't want to draft for the highest scoring players *in general*, but rather you want to draft those 
players that are outliers within their position. I'll borrow a term from video game RPGs and call this the Best-In-Slot 
(BIS) of each position. **Successful strategies should draft players who perform far above the mean for their role**, so 
long as decently strong players are still available in other roles.

There is one more nuance to this point to be highlighted. First, let's do a simple google search for, "which position 
should i prioritize drafting in fantasy football." Here's what I get back as a top result from
[Draft Sharks](https://www.draftsharks.com/kb/best-fantasy-football-draft-strategy):

> What position should you draft first in fantasy football? Short Answer: Most managers should draft a wide receiver with 
> their first pick this season in fantasy football. 6/12 of our top players in our fantasy football rankings are wide
> receivers, 5/12 are running backs, and a single TE slipped into the top 12.

They say WRs and RBs. A quick scan of other sources historically and poll of my football inclined father shows others
seem to agree. So, did I just crack it wide open? Has a novice data scientist revolutionized fantasy?

No, lol.

While standing behind my previous analysis, there are good reasons that one should look for a BIS RB or WR before a BIS
TE. One of these reasons I will attribute to a corrolary of [Ahmdal's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl%27s_law), 
which is originally pulled from computer architecture. In a nutshell, Ahmdal's Law provides a formula we can use to 
compute how much some process composed of several steps can be sped up by optimizing any single one of those steps. 
Borrowing notation from wikipedia, it mathematically looks like this:

$$S_{latency}(s) = \frac{1}{(1 - p) + \frac{p}{s}}$$

where
- $$S_{latency}$$ is the theoretical speedup of the overall process
- $$p$$ is the proportion of time the step being optimized makes up of the overall process
- $$s$$ is the factor of speed up on the particular step being optimized

So, for example, let's say it takes you 20 minutes to cook a steak, 5 minutes to season and 15 to cook. If you could 
either get a better salt grinder to speedup the time it takes you to season by 3x or get a better pan to speedup the time 
it takes to cook by 2x, which would you choose? Some plugging and chugging shows the grinder gives a 1.2x overall speedup 
while the pan gives a 1.6x speedup, so it's the pan (and it's not even close!).

An undergraduate's intuition of Ahmdal's Law is that, if you are going to optimize any step in a process, you should 
optimize the one that takes the longest. We can use the same math to describe our fantasy team. Instead of a process 
taking a sum of time of its steps, we have a total number of points we score that is just the sum of points we get from 
members on our team. For example, let's say you anticipate getting about 18 points from your QB, 22 from your WR, 20 from 
your RB, 12 from your TE, and 4 from your K. Let's also say that you can 1.5x the performance of any one of them by 
picking their position first in the draft. The following table summarizes the overall improvement to your team's 
performance in each case:

| Role Optimized | Points from Optimized Role | Points from Other Roles | Overall Estimated Points |
|----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| WR             | 33                         | 54                      | 87                       |
| RB             | 30                         | 56                      | 86                       |
| QB             | 27                         | 58                      | 85                       |
| TE             | 18                         | 64                      | 82                       |
| K              | 06                         | 72                      | 78                       |

In summary, if you can only get the BIS of any one position, it ought to be the highest scoring one, which tends to be WR 
or RB. To remain consistent with prior bold statements, **successful strategies with prioritize the BIS of higher scoring 
positions**.

I hear what you're thinking (and by you I mean me): "Which is it then? Should strategies pick a players in weaker roles who 
out-perform their peers by wider margins or players in stronger roles who out-perform their peers by more modest margins?" 
Well, ideally, you should pick players who have both: players in strong roles who out-perform their peers by a wide margin. 
If there are no options that satisfy both, then the tradeoff lies in the numbers (by *how much* is the player 
out-performing? by *how much* is their role stronger?).

## Diversify, diversify, diversify
As the saying goes, putting all of one's eggs in one basket is begging for disaster. The same intuition ought to be
applied to fantasy: drafting several of your players from the same team will result in a feast-or-famine output. While
this may or may not necessarily cause a drop in our average performance over a long enough time scale, we only have 16
weeks in the season. The initiated will recognize this as variance or standard deviation, which captures how much our
team's performance varies from week to week. To achieve a consistent performance, **successful strategies will minimize
variance in performance by spreading players out between teams**.

Another good reason to diversity your team is that not every team plays every week! A player who isn't playing for the
week is as good as being benched, so **successful strategies should have an active player in each role every week**.
